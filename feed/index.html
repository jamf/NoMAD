										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>NoMAD 1.1.4</h1>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Overall, a mix of small tweaks, some bug fixes in particular to automatic cert generation and keychain item handling. If you’re using NoMAD to pull certs, this would be a good update to do, otherwise most of the other changes are more minor.</p>
<h2><strong>Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Most of the changes are non-UI based. The biggest impact to the users may be the icon change when clicking on the icon as we use the dark icon to invert when clicked on. If you&#8217;re using custom icons, make sure you&#8217;ve set a the dark ones as well to allow for this inversion.</p>
<p>We hope to address our longest running issue, the lack of a Kerberos domain being set, when attempting to change a password for the first time. With 1.1.4 we will now write out a preference file to ~/Library/com.apple.Kerberos.plist with your AD domain as soon as NoMAD is launched for the first time.</p>
<p>An additional long-running issue is also addressed in that using the TitleSignIn key will work more consistently.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, if you&#8217;re using NoMAD to automatically pull certs, this would be a good update to install as a number of issues have been fixed.</p>
<h2><strong>Change Log</strong></h2>
<div class=""></div>
<div class="">
<div class="">&#8211; fix for Sign In window not fully displaying</div>
<div class="">&#8211; About menu now in menu</div>

<div class="">&#8211; Kerberos preferences written out on first launch to further prevent the &#8220;Domain not found&#8221; error when changing passwords</div>
<div class="">&#8211; Certificate expiration computed better, and won&#8217;t crash on an already expired cert</div>
<div>&#8211; Automatically getting certs won&#8217;t cause a massive amount of certs to be generated</div>
<div class="">&#8211; Certificate cleaning will only happen if asked</div>

<p>This is Joel Rennich, founder of NoMAD.</p>
<p>You may know him as the boisterous blonde guy at Mac conferences who worked at Apple for 11 years and started AFP548.com decades ago.</p>
<p>At Orchard &amp; Grove, we know him as the brain (and the boss), who generates huge, brilliant thoughts about Macs in the enterprise — but has trouble finding his sunglasses.</p>
<p>Like Carrie, the NoMAD caribou mascot, Joel is fairly nomadic. He&#8217;s lived in Switzerland, Illinois, D.C., California, and Texas (so far). His work keeps him traveling a lot. In fact, he just earned the 2 million lifetime miles swag from American Airlines. He&#8217;s spent most of his adult life on the road talking to companies and organizations about how they can make Mac products work best in their environments. He&#8217;s extremely passionate about his work, and NoMAD is his second baby (but don&#8217;t tell his son that).</p>
<p>Leaving Apple wasn&#8217;t an easy choice, but in his new career he&#8217;s never far from the &#8220;AppleVerse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I enjoy the freedom to explore the projects I really want to do &#8212; and the significant decrease in conference calls,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But what I didn&#8217;t realize when I started Orchard &amp; Grove is that the engineering is the easy part of the job. The amount of overhead and paperwork that is required in order to run a small company is annoyingly difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which is why he has hired a small team of experts who have his back. We&#8217;ll highlight a team member each month, so you can get to know us better. Because to know us is to love us, right?</p>
<p>Right?!?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><b>by Josh Wisenbaker, Head of Engineering</b></h3>
<p>As we have been pushing to the initial 1.0 release of NoMAD Login AD a surprising topic<img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-438 alignright" src="https://nomad.menu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nomad-login-logo-12.20-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> has come up quite a bit. Many admins are asking what the differences are between the different types of user accounts on macOS. By account type, we aren&#8217;t talking about the difference between an admin and user, but between local, network, or mobile. All of these account types have existed on macOS for a long time, but there are still many nuances that can trip you up at first.</p>
<p>The NoMAD product line knows how to deal with these account types in order to keep things moving along in your deployment. In light of some of the confusion that is out there about what makes each account type unique, we&#8217;ve prepared a quick primer on them. Each of these sections describes the different sort of user accounts that you can have on macOS and features that are unique to each of them.</p>
<p><span id="more-437"></span><em><strong>Local Account:</strong></em></p>
<p>This is the default type of account on macOS. Simply it is an account that is created on a Mac and all of the information for it resides there. If you create an account with the Users &amp; Groups pane of System Preferences, or with the sysadminctl tool, this is what you will get. These accounts live in the local node of Directory Services (DSLocal) and the authentication authority for the account is simply the local hash file. Nice and simple.</p>
<p><em><strong>Network Account:</strong></em></p>
<p>Things are a bit more complicated with a network account, although not all that confusing. These accounts live in a directory service that isn&#8217;t on the Mac. Typically this is some form of LDAP, with Active Directory being one of the most common. In order to access these accounts the Mac is connected to the remote service and then users can be looked up and authenticated according to the search order that is setup on the Mac. No part of the account is on the Mac and information, while cached for performance, ultimately must be looked up repeatedly from the network source. In the Mac world, pure network accounts are most often used now on the server side, where a macOS server can lookup things like group memberships. With deployments full of portable computers the network dependency is an obvious issue as you won&#8217;t be able to get anything to work if you disconnect from the network, let alone try to get work done on an airplane. This brings us to the…</p>
<p><strong><em>Mobile Account:</em></strong></p>
<p>This account type is the most widely deployed if you are binding your Mac computers to AD. Simply put, a mobile account caches a network account onto your Mac. In theory this allows you to simply use it wherever you are. If you are on the network the account will authenticate to the network. If you are off the network the account will rely on the cached copy of the authentication authority for the user account. This all wonderful until it hits a snag, which it does ALL THE TIME.</p>
<p>If a user simply closes their MacBook and walks off without first logging out and disconnecting from the network, then it will still think it is connected to the network when re-opened. This then can lead to a long timeout when trying to unlock their screen. Normally you are going to hit a two minute timeout for the connection in general and then two minutes for each lookup attempt that has been made. This all adds up and the practical result is that the user is locked out of their Mac until they do a hard reset, losing whatever work they had opened and unsaved.</p>
<p>This happens because the cached authentication authority for the account is the Kerberos realm of the network directory service. Since it is always tried first this leads to the pinwheel of doom and a support desk call. Not coincidentally, this is the exact scenario that NoMAD was designed to address. It allows you to use a local account, but also access a remote authentication authority when you need it.</p>
<p><strong><em>External Account:</em></strong></p>
<p>Here is something that most folks have never run into. An external account is simply a mobile account that isn&#8217;t cached in the local directory services of the Mac. At first that seems confusing, but it&#8217;s fairly simple. When a mobile account is created a cached copy of the account is put into the DSLocal node of the Mac. Another copy of the account is also cached though in an invisible file named .account in the root of the user&#8217;s home folder. If that file is found on a disk by another Mac it can be used to allow access to the system. If the account is known by a shared directory service then it&#8217;s simply allowed to login. If the account isn&#8217;t known to the Mac then the user will be presented with a dialog box that asks if you would like to allow the account to have access.</p>
<p>External accounts are a cool idea that never really took off. I used to make admin accounts that only existed on a thumb drive and could be plugged into a Mac to work on it, but the effort never really seemed to be justified by the payout. (If you want to see what the experience is like, put a Mac with a mobile account on it into Target Disk Mode and then plug it into another Mac that is sitting at the Loginwindow.)</p>
<p><strong><em>NoMAD and the Account Types:</em></strong></p>
<p>NoMAD and NoMAD Login can deal with these different account types to make the user experience on your Mac better.</p>
<p>When using NoMAD, we automatically determine if the account is a mobile account or not. If it is a mobile account then we defer to the authentication authority and AD settings of the Mac. This is done to prevent any conflicts with the account arising. If you unbind your Mac from AD, which is common after installing NoMAD, then your local account will still be able to access the Kerberos SSO realm, without any of the lockout and pinwheel issues of using a mobile account. In short, it is the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>NoMAD Login takes this a step further with a feature we call &#8220;Demobilization&#8221;. When using this setting, NoMAD Login will actually reverse the mobile account creation process, turning the cached account into a local one. Part of this process removes the network authentication authority, thus ending the pinwheels and lockouts. After logging in, users can continue to use NoMAD to gain access to network resources.</p>
<p>That sums it up for the different types of user accounts and how NoMAD interacts with them. As we move forward with our technical blog entires we will cover topics such as these, and more, in more depth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This started off as a smaller update, then got bigger&#8230;</p>
<p>Some cool new features, a few bug fixes, and then a big new feature that we know will evolve some over time. In addition, NoMAD is now all in Swift 4 and all the warnings in Xcode are gone. You can thank Josh for that work.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer password prompts when updating keychain items. In fact&#8230; you should have no password prompts.</li>
<li>We dug deep into Kerberos and should have squashed the annoying &#8220;Domain not set&#8221; issue when attempting to change your password through NoMAD for the first time.</li>
<li>Recursive group search works with &#8220;,&#8221; in user names.</li>
<li>Allow for both and expired AD password and a non-matching local password at the same time.</li>
<li>Better handling of the current date when looking for UPC alerts. This should minimize erroneous UPC Alerts.</li>
<li>Better handling of when your SSL Cert template doesn&#8217;t actually exist on the Windows CA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Match any keychain item account for updates with <code>&lt;&lt;ANY&gt;&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>When using UPCAlerts and a URL for the password change type, NoMAD will check for new passwords every 30 seconds for 15 minutes to catch the new password change even faster.</li>
<li>The Sign In window is now unable to be closed if <code>SignInAlert</code> is set and the user has not signed in at least once.</li>
<li>The current AD site being used is written out to the preference file.</li>
<li>Known bad domain controllers can be blocked by listing them as an array of FQDNs in <code>LDAPServerListDeny</code>.</li>
<li>A new pref key, <code>DontShowWelcomeDefaultOff</code> will pre-tick the &#8220;Don&#8217;t show again&#8221; box on the welcome screen so users won&#8217;t have to do it themselves when it first appears.</li>
<li><code>UseKeychainPrompt</code> will now show the Sign In window whenever the user does not have a password in the keychain, even if the user has signed in before.</li>
<li>Certs pulled via NoMAD can have <code>airport</code> and <code>eapolclient</code> added to them with the use of the <code>AllowEAPOL</code> key.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actions Menu</strong></p>
<p>We thought this would take us a bit longer&#8230; but NoMAD now includes a full actions menu which can hold as many &#8220;actions&#8221; as you&#8217;d like. Each action is a customized menu item that can have scripts and other built in actions behind it. Each item can have multiple actions chained together plus the ability to show or hide the item and even put red/yellow/green dots next to the items.</p>
<p>This is a fairly robust way of putting as many custom menu items as you&#8217;d like into a submenu in NoMAD.</p>
<p>You can read all about it <a href="https://gitlab.com/Mactroll/NoMAD/blob/Experimental/NoMAD/ACTIONS%20README.md">here</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce that NoMAD 1.1 is available! Here&#8217;s an overview of what&#8217;s changed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Shares Menu &#8211; this is our biggest new feature since the initial launch of NoMAD almost a year ago. The Shares Menu allows you to provide a number of file shares for your users and mount them as needed based upon group membership and with variable substitution in the URLs.</li>
<li>Keychain Item synching &#8211; NoMAD will updated a collection of Keychain items each time the user changes his or her password in AD.</li>
<li>802.1x TLS profiles &#8211; NoMAD can associate a user cert from AD with an 802.1x wireless profile.</li>
<li>Welcome window &#8211; first time users of NoMAD can be shown a standard introduction to what NoMAD is, or get a custom HTML page that&#8217;s specific for your environment.</li>
<li>Recursive group lookups &#8211; you can specify all groups to be returned, including nested groups. Note that this may increase look up times.</li>
<li>FirstRunDone &#8211; in conjunction with the Welcome window, you can now know when the first time NoMAD has run.</li>
<li>Anonymous LDAP &#8211; NoMAD can now be functional in non-AD environments that have anonymous binding.</li>
<li>Open Directory Support &#8211; there is now a specific setting for OD to handle the differences between OD and other forms of LDAP servers.</li>
<li>Sign In Window changes &#8211; the sign in window can be excluded from automatically showing for certain users. This is particular handy for when you login to a machine as a local admin and do not want to be pestered by the NoMAD Sign In window constantly popping up. On the other hand, NoMAD can now be configured to make the Sign In window pop to the front of all windows in the Finder on a regular basis for users that either forget to sign in or are actively trying to ignore signing in.</li>
<li>More user attributes &#8211; NoMAD will now record a users&#8217;s e-mail address and UPN from his or her AD account and store this in NoMAD&#8217;s preference file.</li>
<li>Fix for High Sierra not updating passwords in AD when changing the password for Mobile Accounts.</li>
<li>Russian localization</li>
<li>Some updates to having NoMAD use more of the Kerberos APIs for things like determining which of your current Kerberos tickets is your default.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please see our knowledge base article on all preferences to see the new ones for 1.1 that can manage these settings.</p>
