For example, we may partner with other companies to process your payments or store your data to support delivery of our products or services. Whenever we share data with third-party services, we require that they use your information only for the purposes we\u2019ve authorized, and that they protect your personal information at least to the same standards we do.<\/p>\n<p>We also reserve the right to disclose personal information for the following limited purposes:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Business Transfers.<\/b>\u00a0 As O&amp;G continues to develop its business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the obligations made in any pre-existing privacy policy.<\/li>\n<li><b>Legal Obligations<\/b>. O&amp;G may share your personal information if we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to:\u00a0 (i) comply with legal process or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of O&amp;G; (iii) enforce this Privacy Policy or the Website Terms and Conditions of Access and Use Agreement; (iv) protect the interests of other users of the Site or any other person; or (v) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of the Site or equipment.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Otherwise, your personal information is never shared with any individual or other organization.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><b><\/b><b>Protection of your Personal Information<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We take the security of your personal information seriously, and follow industry-standard practices to protect the data we collect and process. For the most part we collect as little information as possible in order to provide goods and services to you and we make every attempt to safeguard the information that we do need. O&amp;G has put in place commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information that O&amp;G collects. Access to personal information will be restricted to our authorized personnel who require the information in order to perform their duties properly. In addition, access will be limited to only that information that is strictly necessary for the performance of those duties.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where you have chosen or we have given you a user name and password for access to certain parts of the Site or Services, you are responsible for keeping the user name and password confidential. No method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so O&amp;G cannot guarantee its absolute security.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><b><\/b><b>Data Transfers<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Because O&amp;G is a US-based company, your information may be collected and processed in the United States. Additionally, as part of the products and services offered to you through our Site, the information which we collect about you may be transferred to, and stored in, one or more countries other than where you currently reside. For example, this may occur if any of our servers or third-party service providers are located in a country other than yours. These countries may have different data protection laws that are similar to your current residence. However, if we transfer your information in this way, we will put in place appropriate protection to make sure your personal data remains adequately protected and is treated in line with this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><b><\/b><b>European Union Residents<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Data protection law in Europe requires a \u201clawful basis\u201d for collecting and retaining personal information from residents of the European Economic Area.

We sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in running our business, including for delivering our products and services, fraud prevention, quality assurance, and marketing purposes, as long as our use of your data does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests. This allows us to improve and develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><b><\/b><b>Email Notifications<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We try to keep email communications to a minimum, and give you the ability to opt in to any marketing communications we send.

If we have sent you a promotional email or mobile device notification, you may send us a return email or mobile device communication asking to be omitted from future email or mobile device distributions. This opt out does not apply to information provided to NoMAD as a result of a product purchase, product service experience, or other transactions.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><b><\/b><b>Retention<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary to perform the relevant processing activity for that information, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with us.

For example, we may retain your data for as long as you maintain an account on our Site so that we may process and deliver your orders. We may also be legally required to hold some types of information to fulfill our statutory obligations. We review our retention periods for personal information on a regular basis.
